        <h3> Recommendation </h3>

        <p class="hoo"> From the <span class="class2">company's </span> point of view, the purpose of introducing the system should be clearly defined, 
            and the fact that the failure of the system can cause great disaster should not be overlooked.
            Since developing a system requires users to clearly understand what information they want to know through this system, 
            executives must communicate with the development team actively. 
            Although everyone wants the system to be introduced quickly and the company to go well,  
            being fast is not always good. If you want a stable system, 
            you should give the developer enough time.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="hoo"> From the <span class="class3"> developer's </span> point of view, 
            even if time is running out,
            this development methodology should be advanced step by step. 
            At each stage, there should be no one in the team who does not know the information. 
            Sufficient time and communication are the most important. 
            There are four steps to successfully implement the ERP system: identification, design, verification, and deployment phase.
